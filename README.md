To the SPA
==========

This is a sample project that uses only server-side rendering.

The Requirement
---------------

The boss just stopped by your cube.  He said, "The order page is slow.  Can you make it do that AJAX thing?"

Your task
---------

Transform the current "post-back" model to open each order into a jQuery AJAX call to get the lines and then display them in place.
